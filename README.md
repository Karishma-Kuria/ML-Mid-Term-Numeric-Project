Project Statement:

Football also known as soccer in various countries is a very popular game worldwide. In the mid nineteenth century football arose in England. FIFA (Federation Internationale Football Association) was founded in 1904. FIFA serves as the international body governing football for both men and women. According to FIFA, it has 300,000 clubs with around 240 million players.

Opportunity to work with a large database of football data is the driving factor of the project. The database used in this project is collected from various sports news channels like BBC, ESPN and also includes data collected from data scraping in web.

In this collab, I have explored various data mining techniques, which includes visualization, Exploratory data analysis of the dataset. I have applied various Machine learning algorithms to discover existing insights from the data.

The dataset contains details of 9,074 games, totaling 941,009 events which were played in the biggest 5 European football leagues: Spain, England, Germany, Italy, France from 2011/2012 season to 2016/2017 season as of 25.01.2017.
The dataset contains 3 files:

dictionary.txt
events.csv
ginf.csv

### Classification / Regression
The main objective of classification and regression problem are as follows:

1. To find which team wins the match. So we have used Full Time Result as the target variable for Regression and Classification Algorithms. For doing feature selection and model explainability , we have used Shap values and selected the top scoring feature for model training.

2. Predict if a shot is goal or no goal.
